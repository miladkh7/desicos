Overview
=========================
Purpose
--------------------------
This software was created to generate random cylinder and cones for computer simulations.
Inputs are 3D scanned clouds of points. 
Using spectral representation method new samples can be generated from these clouds of points.

Known problems, missing fuctions
----------------------------------
Please note that you are using Pre-Release version of this software, therefore some features are missing.

Currently missing features:
 - theoratical manual
 - full cone support
 - material pattern generation
 - viewing of thickness imperfections

Known problems:
 - new sample generation is slow
 - some messages are not displayed

.. note:: 
   This program already acomes with some imperfection samples, but these vere generated by this program, and are for demonstration purposes only.
